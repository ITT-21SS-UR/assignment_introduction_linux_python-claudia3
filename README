Welcome to the GNOME FTP tree.

Here is a little guide:

  sources/

    This is a huge tree of released tarballs for each module. If this
    directory does not exist on your mirror, they have chosen to provide
    just the major release tarballs. You will find them under the following
    directories.

  apps/
  core/
  
    These directories are for major GNOME 3 releases in each category.

  admin/
  platform/
  desktop/
  bindings/
  devtools/
  mobile/

    These directories are for major GNOME 2 releases in each category.

  teams/

    This is an FTP area for the various GNOME subprojects, such as
    documentation, usability, i18n and accessibility.

  binaries/

    This directory holds binaries released by various GNOME sub projects.

  misc/

    This directory has miscellaneous things.

Thanks and enjoy,

The GNOME Team
